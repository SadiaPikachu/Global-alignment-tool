            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Sadia Tabassum, the developer behind the Global Alignment Tool. I created this tool to help students easily perform sequence alignment for their projects and class tasks. I graduated from the Biomedical Engineering department at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology. My goal is to make sequence analysis more accessible by providing a clean, user-friendly interface without unnecessary complexity.</p>

            <h2>Attention:</h2>
            <p>The sequence alignment results might not always be correct, especially with sequences that have repeating parts (like ACGAA). However, the substitution matrix is accurate and can still help check the alignment results.</p>
            <p>This tool is not ideal for very long sequences or those with big length differences. It works best for short sequences and is especially helpful for class tasks.</p>
