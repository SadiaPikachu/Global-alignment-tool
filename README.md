# Global Alignment Tool

## About The Tool
The **Global Alignment Tool** is designed to assist students in performing sequence alignment for academic projects and class assignments. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the tool offers a clean and user-friendly interface for sequence analysis. It simplifies sequence comparison tasks and supports students in their learning, all without unnecessary complexity.
You can check out the tool here: [Needleman-Wunsch Alignment Tool](https://sadiapikachu.github.io/Needleman-wunsch-alignment-tool/)

## Features
- **Sequence Alignment**: Perform global sequence alignment with options to specify match/mismatch points and gap penalties.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and simple, making it easy for students to use.
- **Accurate Substitution Matrix**: Ensures reliable alignment results for most sequences.

## Limitations
- **Accuracy**: The sequence alignment results may not always be correct, especially for sequences with repeating parts (e.g., ACGAA).
- **Not Ideal for Long Sequences**: While the substitution matrix is accurate, this tool is less suitable for very long sequences or those with significant length differences.
- **Best for Short Sequences**: It works best for short sequences, making it ideal for class tasks, but less so for large-scale genomic analysis.

## Code Improvements
I am actively working on enhancing the code for better performance. The current **JavaScript** code has been obfuscated to protect its integrity. However, I am open to further improvements and optimizations.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure and layout of the tool.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the sequence alignment functionality.

## Contact
For feedback, suggestions, or questions, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to improve this tool.
